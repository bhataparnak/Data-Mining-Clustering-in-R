# Data-Mining-Clustering-in-R
This project is about understanding the clustering approach to mining (unsupervised learning). In this project, you will be given weather data set in separate files for the state of Texas for the years 2006 to 2010 (5 years) for analysis using k-means clustering. The data set includes a number of weather stations in Texas (about 200 of them). Each station
collects weather data on an hourly basis for each day throughout the year!
